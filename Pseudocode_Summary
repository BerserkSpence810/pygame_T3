Game Setup:

1.	Initialize Game Necesities
	•	Import (pygame, sys, math)
	•	Initialize Pygame with pygame.init()
	•	Set screen size and frame rate
2.	Load Assets
	•	Load player (blue cube)
	•	Load enemies: Yellow Cube (velocity: 2, size: 50), Green Cube
	•	Load interactable objects (red cubes, buttons)
	•	Load GUI elements (Wallet)
	•	Set background music and sound effects
3.	Define Global Variables
	•	Player health, score, jump speed, movement speed
	•	Enemy parameters (size, speed, behavior)
	•	Platform positions and boundaries
	•	GUI elements (wallet, inventory, buttons)
	•	Game state variables (fade transitions)
4.	Classes
	•	Player Class: Handles movement, jump, item interaction (with "E")
	•	Enemy Class: Handles movement of yellow and green cubes (yellow follows player, green Larger follows slower)
	•	Platform Class: Handles platform positioning and collision detection
	•	GUI Class: Handles money, inventory
5.	Collision Detection
	•	Detect collisions between the player and platforms
	•	Detect interaction (‘E’) with objects like red cubes and the NEXT button
	•	Detect enemy and player collisions (trigger death cutscene message)
6.	Game Loop
	•	Clear screen
	•	Update player position based on velocity and gravity
	•	Handle collisions with platforms and enemies
	•	Update GUI
	•	Display game objects (player, enemies, platforms, buttons)
	•	Detect interactions (pick-up-able items, NEXT button)
	•	Trigger transitions between levels
7.	Level Setup
	•	Tutorial Level: Introduce game mechanics
	•	First Level: Introduce yellow cube enemies and platform navigation
	•	Second and Third Levels: Expand on mechanics, including green cube enemies and new challenges
	•	Forth level: Displays different ending depending on collected cube count
8.	Transitions
	•	Implement screen fades between title, tutorial, and levels.
	•	Trigger transitions when the player interacts with the NEXT button or reaches certain objectives
9.	Death
	•	Trigger “You got robbed” scene when killed by cubes.
	•	End after death.
10.	End of Game
	•	Define victory conditions
	•	Reset game state for new playthroughs
